# website builder

Experimental html page that converts markdown files into a website using only APIs that are available in browsers 
Creates RSS and list of posts.

An LLM assisted in the creation of this code, and it's not recommended for consumption

Got idea on how it can do CI/CD? Please open an issue or PR.
